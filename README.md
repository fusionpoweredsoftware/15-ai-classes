## How They Work

1. Identify the task you need to complete. What are the specific requirements of the task? What skills and knowledge are required?
2. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of each expert AI. What areas of expertise does each AI have? What are their limitations?
3. Match the expert AI to the task. Choose the AI whose strengths best align with the requirements of the task. For example, if you need to complete a task that requires creativity and innovation, you might choose the Artistic Alice expert AI.
4. Evaluate the performance of the expert AI. Once you have chosen an expert AI, evaluate its performance on the task. This may involve providing it with a sample task or asking it to complete the task in a simulated environment.
5. Make adjustments as needed. If the expert AI is not performing as expected, you may need to make adjustments to the task or to the AI's parameters.
